Hopefully, you have read [part 1](./gpu-part1.html) and [part 2](./gpu-part2.html) of Learning about GPUs series. This part provides an index of all the useful resources one can consider to get a more advanced understanding of GPUs.

## Learning about the fundamentals

1. [Book] Programming Massively Parallel Processors, A Hands-on Approach By David B. Kirk, Wen-mei W. Hwu
   1. This is the best resource to learn about parallel programming and GPUs. The first 4 chapters explain the fundamentals of GPU hardware and its programming model
2. [YouTube playlist] 12 to 14 videos in [COS 436](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG3vBTUJlY2HdwYsdFCdXQraInoc3j9DU)
3. [CUDA Mode](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJgIbYl6C5no72a0NUAPcTA)
   1. Very good resource for learning about GPUs/CUDA/Triton. They also have a very active Discord
4. [CUDA C++ programming guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html)
   1. Official guide from Nvidia which can be used as a reference
5. [YouTube playlist] [CUDA teaching center](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC6u37oFvF40BAm7gwVP7uDdzmW83yHPe)
   1. Short series to get started in CUDA and get a refresher on GPU hardware
