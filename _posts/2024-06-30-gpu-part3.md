Hopefully, you have read [part 1](./gpu-part1.html) and [part 2](./gpu-part2.html) of Learning about GPUs series. This part provides an index of all the useful resources one can consider to get a more advanced understanding of GPUs.

## Learning about the fundamentals

1. [Book] Programming Massively Parallel Processors, A Hands-on Approach By David B. Kirk, Wen-mei W. Hwu
   1. This is the best resource to learn about parallel programming and GPUs. The first 4 chapters explain the fundamentals of GPU hardware and its programming model
2. [YouTube playlist] 12 to 14 videos in [COS 436](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG3vBTUJlY2HdwYsdFCdXQraInoc3j9DU)
3. [CUDA Mode](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJgIbYl6C5no72a0NUAPcTA)
   1. Very good resource for learning about GPUs/CUDA/Triton. They also have a very active Discord
4. [CUDA C++ programming guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html)
   1. Official guide from Nvidia which can be used as a reference
5. [YouTube playlist] [CUDA teaching center](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC6u37oFvF40BAm7gwVP7uDdzmW83yHPe)
   1. Short series to get started in CUDA and get a refresher on GPU hardware

## Notable Talks

1. [GPU Optimization session hosted by Chip Huyen](https://www.youtube.com/live/v_q2JTIqE20)
2. [GTC 2022 - How CUDA Programming Works - Stephen Jones, CUDA Architect, NVIDIA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQceTDjA4f4)

## Notable blogs

1. [What every developer should know about GPU computing](https://codeconfessions.substack.com/p/gpu-computing)
   1. Gentle introduction to the GPU programming model
2. [What shapes do Matrix Multiplication Like?](https://www.thonking.ai/p/what-shapes-do-matrix-multiplications)
   1. Puzzles to test your understanding of GPU hardware

## Programming tutorials

1. [Tiled matrix multiplication](https://penny-xu.github.io/blog/tiled-matrix-multiplication) in CUDA
2. Matrix multiplication in pure CUDA: [How to Optimize a CUDA Matmul Kernel for cuBLAS-like Performance: a Worklog](https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM)
3. [GPU puzzles by Srush](https://github.com/srush/GPU-Puzzles)
4. [Triton puzzles by Srush](https://github.com/srush/Triton-Puzzles)
