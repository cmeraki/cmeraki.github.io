        <h1>Teachable agents</h1>
        Agents depend on the underlying LLM to plan and act. What LLM does not know cannot be done by an agent. We are building agents that learn from examples. Here are a few areas we are currently working on:
        <ol>
            <li>Imitation learning</li>
            <li>Action models</li>
            <li>Screen Parsing</li>
            <li>Generalisation of learning</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Why are we building something new?</h3>
        Today, when we think of AI doing our work, we think of AI agents.
        <ul>
            <li>AI agents are powerful tools that can do complicated tasks for you. You can explain the task and they will do it for you
            (eg: Plan an office party for me). But the limitation lies in a good feedback loop (from the user) and adapting to your
            personal needs.</li>
            <li>Most of the current agents use LLMs like GPT. These LLMs compress all available knowledge on the internet and form a
            world model. Agents based on them use this world model to accomplish tasks.</li>
            <li>Agents can do what the LLM knows, but cannot be taught new things. These agents can achieve simple tasks for us like
            booking tickets on websites. But they will not be able to file your taxes for you! Why? Simply because it does not know
            what tools you use, where you file your taxes, what data you look at etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Hence, we are building capabilities to build learnable and teachable AI agents. Anyone can <strong>show</strong> these agents how they
            prefer to carry out a complex task and the agent can do it independently from next time. This becomes more important
            when you are using proprietary tools (which a traditional agent doesnâ€™t know how to use so it just keeps guessing) or
            you have a certain way of doing things.
