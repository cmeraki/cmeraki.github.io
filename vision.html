        <p>Humans have evolved to work with each other. We have a complex social structure where we make groups and
            solve problems. We understand quorum and the importance of visibility and sharing information. We also
            improvise and don't need help at every step.</p>
        <h3 id="software-is-broken">Software is broken</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Softwares <strong>don't talk to each other</strong>. Humans act as glue to make software work with
                    each other. We download PDFs from Gmail to read numbers in it, input these numbers in Excel, then
                    apply formulas, and send the Excel over Gmail. Over a billion people in the world act as this glue
                    today in their daily jobs. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Software <strong>cannot perform new tasks</strong> unless explicitly programmed to do so. You cannot
                    ask Gmail to download all emails that have PDFs, because Google engineers didn&#39;t program Gmail
                    to do that. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Software <strong>needs human supervision for nearly every step</strong>. It cannot independently
                    adapt or problem-solve.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Software is hard and <strong>expensive to modify</strong>. Even simple changes require engineering
                    work.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Today's <strong>AI is broken software</strong>. OpenAI has given us intelligence in a box in the form
                    of ChatGPT, but it still needs human oversight and action. ChatGPT knows how to use Gmail, but can
                    only output text instructions to do so. A human is still required to follow those instructions. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="humans-are-the-glue">Humans are the glue</h3>
        <p>As a result, <strong>companies hire a lot of people to "glue" systems together</strong>. E.g. in a finance
            team at one of the companies in India, over 60 people are employed. 80% of their time is spent on doing
            repetitive tasks with software. If the software were not so broken, this could be done by 10 people. </p>
        <h3 id="our-vision">Our vision</h3>
        <p>Tomorrow's <strong>software will do things on its own</strong>. Teams will be able to teach it how they do
            things, and it should do them. It will learn your workflows, processes and systems. It will work alongside
            humans to dramatically increase our productivity.
            New ways for humans to teach, interact, explain to software will emerge. Such software will empower
            employees to focus their talents on creative, strategic thinking, which would make it much easier for
            companies to scale their business.</p>
