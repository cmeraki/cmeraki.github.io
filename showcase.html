                        <p>Machine learning for credit card fraud detection (ML for CCFD) has become an active research field. This is illustrated by the remarkable amount of publications on the topic in the last decade.
It makes no doubt that the integration of machine learning techniques in payment card fraud detection systems has greatly improved their ability to more efficiently detect frauds. At the same time, a major issue in this new research field is the lack of reproducibility. There do not exist any recognized benchmarks, nor methodologies, to compare and assess the proposed techniques.
